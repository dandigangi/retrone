# Retrone

Wasn't a huge fan of manually running retro's with a Confluence page. Tested a few tools made by others and wasn't satisfied either. Planned to make my own but ended up finding something we liked.

Making this for fun to play around w/ NextJS and learn more TS. Need to shake off the rust. Don't get many opporutnties to code now a days in management.

### TODO

-   Model data contracts (in progress)
-   Return mocked data contracts to UI
-   Display mocked data on dashboard and board page
-   Build create board action

### Figure Out

-   Persistence (might just use Node to write to fs)
-   Typescript (frustrating to learn - concepts make sense but haven't figured out all the synax or how to apply correctly)
