# Retrone

Wasn't a huge fan of manually running retro's with a Confluence page. Tested a few tools made by others and wasn't satisfied either. Planned to make my own but ended up finding something we liked.

Making this for fun to play around w/ NextJS and learn more TS. Need to shake off the rust. Don't get many opporutnties to code now a days in management.

### TODO

-   Switch to Next's layout component
-   Switch to CSS-in-JS styles
-   Model data contracts (in progress)
-   Return mocked data contracts to UI
-   Display mocked data on dashboard and board page
-   Build create board action and factory
-   Type files
